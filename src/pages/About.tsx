                My name is Trevor Brown! I'm a software engineer, web developer and a tutor!
                I was born an engineer. I grew up in upstate New York and taught myself to code
                at 10 years old. I spent many hours with an old laptop, and a notebook copying down code by hand
                and reading any book I could find at Barnes &amp; Noble.

                Programming is my passion and I'm here to share that passion with you!
                If you like what you see, scroll down and lets chat!
